I am a research associate at the [Institute for Computing Systems
Architecture](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) within the [School of
Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the [University of
Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

I am interested in programming languages, parallel programming, and
combinatorial optimization. During my doctoral education at [KTH Royal Institute
of Technology](http://www.kth.se/en) (completed in 2018) and as a researcher at
[RISE SICS](http://www.sics.se/) in Sweden, I have studied the application of
[constraint programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) to
[compiler optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_optimization) in
the [Unison](http://unison-code.github.io/) project. The project has made a
broad impact, including [numerous publications](/publications.html) in
international venues,
a mature and reusable [open-source
tool](https://github.com/unison-code/unison), [industrial
value](https://www.ericsson.com/research-blog/outperforming-state-art-compilers-unison/),
and a Honorable Mention at the
[2019 ACP Doctoral Research Award](https://www.a4cp.org/awards/doctoral-research-award).

Other areas of interest are software testing and verification. I am always open
to broadening the scope of my research, so do not hesitate to
[contact me](/contact.html) with exciting research ideas!
