I am a software engineer and researcher, with an interest in programming
languages, parallel programming, and combinatorial optimization.

I worked as a research associate at the
[Institute for Computing Systems Architecture](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa)
within the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the
[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

During my doctoral education at
[KTH Royal Institute of Technology](http://www.kth.se/en) and as a researcher at
[RISE SICS](http://www.sics.se/) in Sweden, I studied the application of
[constraint programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) to
[compiler optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_optimization) in
the [Unison](http://unison-code.github.io/) project. The project made a broad
impact, including [numerous publications](/publications.html) in international
venues, a mature and reusable
[open-source tool](https://github.com/unison-code/unison),
[industrial value](https://www.ericsson.com/research-blog/outperforming-state-art-compilers-unison/),
and a Honorable Mention at the
[2019 ACP Doctoral Research Award](https://www.a4cp.org/awards/doctoral-research-award).

Other areas of interest are software testing and verification. I am always open
to broadening the scope of my research, so do not hesitate to
[contact me](/contact.html) with exciting research ideas!
