I am a researcher at the [Computer Systems
Laboratory](http://www.sics.se/groups/computer-systems-laboratory-csl), [RISE
RICS](http://www.sics.se/) (Swedish Institute of Computer Science).

I am interested in programming languages and combinatorial optimization. During
my doctoral education at [KTH Royal Institute of
Technology](http://www.kth.se/en) (completed in 2018), I have studied the
application of [constraint
programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) to [compiler
optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_optimization) in the
[Unison](http://unison-code.github.io/) project. The project has made a broad
impact, including [numerous publications](/publications.html) in international
venues, a mature and reusable [open-source
tool](https://github.com/unison-code/unison), and [industrial
value](https://www.ericsson.com/research-blog/outperforming-state-art-compilers-unison/).

Other areas of interest are software testing and verification. I am always open
to broaden the scope of my research, so do not hesitate [contacting
me](/contact.html) with exciting research ideas!
