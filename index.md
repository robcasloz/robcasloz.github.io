I am a software engineer and researcher, with an interest in programming
languages, software testing and verification, and combinatorial optimization.

I currently work at Oracle as an [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) compiler
engineer. Previously, I worked as a research associate at the
[Institute for Computing Systems Architecture](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa)
within the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

I attained my doctoral degree in 2018 at
[KTH Royal Institute of Technology](http://www.kth.se/en) while working as a
researcher at [RISE SICS](http://www.sics.se/), Sweden. During my doctoral
studies, I applied
[constraint programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) to
[compiler optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_optimization) in
the [Unison](http://unison-code.github.io/) project. The project made a broad
impact, including [numerous publications](/publications.html) in international
venues, a mature and reusable
[open-source tool](https://github.com/unison-code/unison),
[industrial value](https://www.ericsson.com/research-blog/outperforming-state-art-compilers-unison/),
and a Honorable Mention at the
[2019 ACP Doctoral Research Award](https://www.a4cp.org/awards/doctoral-research-award).
